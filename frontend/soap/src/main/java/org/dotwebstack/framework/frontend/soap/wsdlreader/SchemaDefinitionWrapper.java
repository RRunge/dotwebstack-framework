/**
 * This class was extracted from the soapUI code base by centeractive ag in October 2011.
 * The main reason behind the extraction was to separate the code that is responsible
 * for the generation of the SOAP messages from the rest of the soapUI's code that is
 * tightly coupled with other modules, such as soapUI's graphical user interface, etc.
 * The goal was to create an open-source java project whose main responsibility is to
 * handle SOAP message generation and SOAP transmission purely on an XML level.
 * <br/>
 * centeractive ag would like to express strong appreciation to SmartBear Software and
 * to the whole team of soapUI's developers for creating soapUI and for releasing its
 * source code under a free and open-source licence. centeractive ag extracted and
 * modifies some parts of the soapUI's code in good faith, making every effort not
 * to impair any existing functionality and to supplement it according to our
 * requirements, applying best practices of software design.
 * <p/>
 * Changes done:
 * - changing location in the package structure
 * - removal of dependencies and code parts that are out of scope of SOAP message generation
 * - minor fixes to make the class compile out of soapUI's code base
